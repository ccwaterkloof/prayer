# Strategic prayer

1. Newer religious groups are growing rapidly. This includes evangelicals, but also
marginal groups. The Nazarenes have the longest Protestant presence. More recent arrivals
feature Pentecostals from Brazil and the USA. Pray that more indigenous leaders and pastors may
be trained for these growing groups. Pray that believers might mature and increase despite poverty
and geographic isolation.

2. There are 490,000 Caboverdians living in migrant communities; the largest are
in New England, USA (266,000), Portugal (80,000), Angola (46,000), Senegal and France.
Their remittances are vital to those living in Cape Verde. Pray that many in these communities
may become true disciples of Jesus and be spiritual and economic blessings to their homeland.

3. Pray for biblical preaching free of superstition and fetishism. Pray for vibrant relationships with Jesus to replace religious rules and traditions.

# Strategic prayer

- The Arab Spring began in Tunisia (December 2010). However, after the initial reforms there is continued economic decline and unemployment and the increasing presence of Islamic fundamentalism, and a heavy-handed Prime Minister (who rewrote the constitution to give himself more power) all serve to rob Tunisians of confidence in their countryâ€™s future. Pray that the travails of Tunisia might somehow draw people towards Christ. 
- Believers: barely one quarter of one percent of the population are Christians, and most of these are non-Tunisian. Nearly a third do not congregate with other believers as they live far from one another. Christians face persecution from family and friends, and following Jesus risks their jobs, social stature, and pressure from authorities. Persecution has increased since the revolution, and several church leaders have left the nation due to threats. Without these leaders, evangelism and discipleship are becoming increasingly difficult. 
- The unreached: of the 23 people groups in Tunisia, 14 have never heard the Good News.

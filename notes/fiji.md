# Strategic prayer

- Indigenous Fijians have long resented imported Indian indentured labourers, from 1870 onward.At times, Fijians were a minority in their own country. On the other hand, the Indian communities work hard to build up what they have and yet feel little security in a nation where they cannot own land and where systemic racism undermines their efforts. Pray for a spirit of repentance and reconciliation and for a society marked by freedom and equality.
- New churches with spiritual dynamism and evangelistic vision have surged in growth in the last decade; Pentecostal groups are the most notable among these.Also within the Methodist,Anglican and Catholic churches are strong evangelical/charismatic movements. There are many claims of great revival in Fiji, and there is undeniable fruit of God at work in remarkable ways, as individuals, communities and even the environment see transformation.
- Mission vision. Fiji was once a hotbed of mission-sending throughout the Pacific.This legacy is being revived as YWAM, WEC and CMF have been prominent in channeling Fijians to mission fields around the world. The Deep Sea Canoe Mission seeks to foster a missions vision. Pray for existing missions and for a greater future of Fijian missionary investment.
- Less-reached peoples. The Indians of Fiji form the largest non-Christian community in the Pacific. As few as 3% of them claim to be Christian. The greatest challenges for Indian-majority churches are developing (and retaining) mature and experienced leaders and integrating with the rest of the body of Christ.
- Hindus remain mostly unevangelized. The number of converts to Christianity is accelerating. AoG in particular but also Methodists, Baptists and Pentecostals have seen fruit from this ministry. Multi-racial congregations are springing up among them. Pioneers also has church planting ministries committed to reaching Indians.
- The Muslim community is tightly knit, very resistant to the gospel and increasingly Islamized via Saudi and Pakistani influence. Little is being done to reach them; the few converts to Christ suffer from considerable persecution and from the churchesâ€™ failure to integrate them.

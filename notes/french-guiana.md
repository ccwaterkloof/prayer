# Strategic prayer

- The growth of evangelicals has been steady if not spectacular in the last few decades.
  This is true for many minority groups but also among the Creole, previously considered
  to have few believers. Pentecostal churches and independent house churches have especially
  flourished.
- Give praise for the opening of work among several Amerindian groups, with several
  churches planted among the Caribs/Galibi in particular. Brethren workers from Suriname,
  Full Gospel ministers along the coast, Baptists and Nazarene among Haitians and Brazilian
  Christians in the interior are all making progress.

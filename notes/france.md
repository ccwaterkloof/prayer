# Strategic prayer

- The accelerating decline of religious faith since the 18th Century has seen Franceâ€™s
  Catholic and mainline Protestant legacies plummet in recent years, even as atheism has
  grown. Hostility toward organized religion as well as the privatization of spirituality mean that
  regular attendance in any church is below 8%. Some surveys show that over 30% of French
  people are non-religious. Most French have a profound ignorance of, or indifference to, the
  gospel, many having never meaningfully encountered it. Yet, the relativism of postmodernity has
  generated acute emptiness and existential angst; as many have noted, this in turn has created a
  spiritual hunger that has grown rapidly in recent years. Pray that such hunger might overcome
  the suspicion toward religion. Pray that Christians would be prepared to patiently and relationally
  share Jesus with those who seek
- Evangelical Christianity has grown over the last 50 years despite the systemic secularization
  of society, religious indifference and decline in church involvement. In 1960, evangelicals in
  France numbered 180,000; by 1990, they had reached nearly 400,000, and in 2010, they were
  600,000. Evangelicals meet in over 2,500 fellowships with dozens more forming every year.

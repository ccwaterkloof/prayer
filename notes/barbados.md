# Strategic prayer

- Since settlement in 1627, Barbados has been Christian. But despite overwhelming religious profession and a large number of evangelicals, real commitment to the lordship of Jesus is the exception rather than the rule. Materialism, spreading theological liberalism, decreasing church attendance, increased violence and crime are all symptoms of spiritual decline. Pray for the Spiritâ€™s renewal and for the Church in Barbados to reawaken.
- Young people desperately need spiritual guidance. The culture of immorality is pervasive, and even church-going teens are subject to its temptations. Pray that churches may offer effective programmes for children and youth, while demonstrating positive holiness. Pray also for the ministries of CEF, IS/ISUF(IFES), YFC, YWAM and others, whose potential impact among children and young people is massive.

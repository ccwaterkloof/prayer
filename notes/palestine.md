### Strategic prayer

- A just settlement of the land issue and the future of both Jewish settlements in the Palestinian areas and Palestinians in Israel itself. Both sides feel strong legitimate claims to the land, but their respective national aspirations are mutually exclusive.
- The improvement of living conditions. Estimates are that 70% of Gaza lives in deep poverty and 80% are dependent upon external aid.Widespread unemployment and Israelâ€™s imposition of economic controls prevent the majority from working their way out of poverty.
- A fair apportionment of the water resources. Palestine has access to only 17% of the available water resources, with the remainder used by settlers, by Israel or sold back to Palestine. Only 28% of Gaza has regular access to clean water.
- The political leadership of Palestine and Israel. The Palestinian National Authority is an elected quasi-government which all know has no real power to govern. Pray for a means by which legitimate and effective leadership might govern Palestine.
- The future of Jerusalem, claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians, each as their exclusive capital.

- Arab evangelicals number several thousand in 30 churches, most on the West Bank. They feel isolated and rejected by Jews, Arabs, traditional Christians and even Western evangelicals.The formation and operations of the Council of Local Evangelical Churches in the Holy Land are very positive developments.The loss of leadership through emigration is very damaging. Bethlehem Bible College plays a key role in training new leaders but faces many challenges. Pray for this ministry, and pray for courage, endurance and a spirit of love for evangelicals in Palestine. Pray especially for believers from a Muslim background to stay strong and to grow in their new faith.

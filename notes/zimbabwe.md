# Strategic prayer

- The exodus of millions from Zimbabwe to neighbouring African nations and beyond. This
  “brain drain” includes much of academia, the business community, opposition politicians
  and spiritual leaders. Their emigration, even temporary, is a serious loss to Zimbabwe.
  Pray for the swift and safe return and reconciliation of these people to help rebuild a
  nation on its knees. Pray for strength of community among the Zimbabwean Church and for
  unity befitting their role in reconstruction.
- Couragous leaders to expose and challenge deep-rooted corruption.

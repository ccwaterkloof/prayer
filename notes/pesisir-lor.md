# People profile

The 36 million Java Pesisir Lor live primarily on the north coast of Central Java,
Indonesia. They dwell on lush, gentle mountain slopes and in fertile valleys where they
make a living by farming and fishing. Characteristic cultural activities are Koran reading
and martial arts practice.

The Java Pesisir Lor are 97% Sunni Muslim and are heavily influenced by Folk Islamic
practices.

# Strategic prayer

- Christians have been present throughout Central Java for centuries. Today they number
  almost one million, but it is unclear whether the Java Pesisir Lor have been a part of
  any of the recent movements to Christ.
- Plenty of Christian resources are available in Javanese: the Bible, the Jesus Film,
  radio broadcasts, websites, gospel recordings, and gospel films.
- Pray for spiritual discernment to recognize the falsehood of Islam and pray for a hunger
  for the truth.

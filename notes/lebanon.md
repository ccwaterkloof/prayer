# Strategic prayer

- Lebanon must recover after 70 years of tragic communal wars and foreign interventions. Wars and conflicts have displaced over 80% of the population. Meanwhile, there are over a million refugees seeking shelter in Lebanon – from Palestine, Iraq, Syria, and beyond. Christians, local and expatriate, have cooperated to demonstrate compassion and Christ’s love to the many needy people.
- Massive grassroots protests in 2019 united a normally divided population against the government’s corruption, elitism, and inability to bring economic progress. The government resigned, but no long-term solutions to Lebanon’s many political and economic problems have been found. The massive explosion in Beirut in 2020 and the impact of Covid-19 intensify Lebanon’s woes further. Pray for this biblical land to know the loving mercy and rich blessings of our loving Father.
- Lebanon has long been a key centre for Christian ministries to the whole Middle East. Pray for continued religious freedom.

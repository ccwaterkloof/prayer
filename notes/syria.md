# Strategic prayer

- Violence that erupted since the fall of the Assad regime has targeted ethnic and
  religious minorities, political rivals and the Christian Druze community
- Since the start of the civil war in 2011, millions of Syrians have sought refuge in
  neighboring countries and around the world: 2.7 million in Turkey, about 1 million in
  Lebanon, and over 655,000 in Jordan. Additionally, the war has caused the displacement
  of over six million people within Syria. Pray for Jesus to reveal Himself to the
  millions of Muslims displaced by the war.
- Approximately half the Christian population have fled for their lives, leaving only
  about 250,000 to 300,000 believers in Syria - many of which are displaced. Pray for the
  Church to be protected and expanded amid hostility.

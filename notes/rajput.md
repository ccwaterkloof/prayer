# People profile

Rajput means "Son of the King" in Sanskrit and they form one of the four main Hindu
divisions of South Asia and roughly one fourth of these are Muslims. Muslim Rajputs live
mainly in India and Pakistan, but there are smaller numbers in Bangladesh and Nepal.
Praise God that some Hindu Rajput have become believers but there are no known believers
among the Muslim Rajput.

# Strategic prayer

- Several generations ago, when these people became dissatisfied with their Hindu
  religion, they became Muslims. Because of this they may be more open than many
  traditionally Muslim peoples to hear and receive the love of Christ.
- Pray for more churches to engage these unreached people.
- Pray for families to have access to God's Word and a desire to read it together.
- Pray for movements of entire families and communities turning to Jesus.

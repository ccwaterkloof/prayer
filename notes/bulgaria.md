# Strategic prayer

- Significant growth of evangelical and charismatic believers. Evangelicals went from 0.4% of the population in 1980 to close to 2% today.
- The Orthodox Church needs renewal and new life. A bitter schism weakened and undermined the Church, stemming from the collusion of Orthodox leaders with the former Communist regime. Pray for a genuine move of the Holy Spirit that brings reconciliation of rifts and a full realization of Orthodoxy’s spiritual richness.
- Ethnic minorities suffered severely at times at the hands of the Bulgarian majority. Bulgaria’s straddling of a Balkan,Slavic andTurkish cultural fault line has generated trouble for centuries. Considerable discrimination continues, and both Turks and Gypsies have formed political parties to press for their rights. Pray specifically for the **Rumelian Turks** in the east, the **Millet** - an oppressed Turkish-speaking Gypsy minority, the **Romani** - despised and at the bottom of the social order and the **Bulgarian-speaking Muslims in the south**.

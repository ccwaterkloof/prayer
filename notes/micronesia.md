# Strategic prayer

Biblical Christianity faces challenges on three fronts:

- The **traditional cultural elements** such as the use of magic and of sakau, the herbal drink used as a communal narcotic.
- Another front is the pull of **Western consumerism** encouraged by US aid and the temptation to migrate to the USA.
- **Mormon** missionaries are highly active in Micronesia.
  All three require a response of wisdom and faith. Pray for a revelation of the power and love of Jesus to the peoples of FSM.

# Strategic prayer

1. The Solomons have a history of revivals â€“ in the South Sea Evangelical Churches
   in 1935 and 1970, then in nearly all denominations after 1982.

2. Christian ministry during and since the civil conflict has been a good testimony.
   Peacekeeping efforts by all churches, including the Melanesian Brotherhood (resulting in
   the martyrdom of seven of these Anglican brothers), and counselling to those traumatized have
   been much-needed blessings to the nation.

3. Ethnic diversity and fragmentation as well as geography render the Solomons a
   patchwork of tribes and political groups rather than a unified nation. This hinders not just
   national identity but also Christian ministry. Pray that God might knit these many
   islands and tribes together in the gospel.

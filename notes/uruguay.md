# Strategic prayer

- Evangelicals’ growth is rapidly accelerating.The last 20 years have witnessed significant growth in a country previously very resistant to the gospel. The Evangelical Alliance’s efforts to double the number of congregations between 1998 and 2005 were completed – also doubling the number of believers in the process!
- The recent awakening generates many challenges. Evangelical Alliance churches work together on an unprecedented scale to fulfill the DAWN goals. Pray also for the hugely strategic ministries of the 20 or so seminaries or Bible schools; doubling the number of congregations creates a demand for godly, well-trained pastors. Some schools have been negatively impacted in the past by liberal theology.
- Lack of knowledge of God gives opening to a spirit of error. Afro-Brazilian Spiritism is the fastest growing religion in Uruguay.The largest non-Catholic religious bodies are cults and sects of questionable orthodoxy. While 81% believe in God, most adhere to a “do-it- yourself ” spirituality influenced by New Age thinking. Pray for all religious deceptions to be exposed and the demonic powers behind them defeated.

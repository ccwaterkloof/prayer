# Strategic prayer

- Egypt is arguably the intellectual centre of Sunni Islam, and Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood have grown greatly as they push for a more Islamic state.
- For over 1,000 years, Egypt was a majority-Christian country, even after the Arab Muslim conquest in AD 640. Egypt gave to the Christian world some of its greatest theologians and the monastic movement.
- Today the Coptic Church is by far the largest body of Christians in the Middle East and is a strategic key for the evangelization of the region. Pray for:
- Church leaders, especially the Coptic Pope. Wisdom, grace and confidence are needed in handling the Muslim authorities, Islamist persecution and the questioning world.A close walk with God is essential to be both a bridge between communities and an example to their flock.
- A spiritual awakening Church-wide in the midst of mounting pressures and communal tensions. Many Copts are very nominal. The responses to Muslim agitation need to be humble and loving but strong, and only those walking in faith are capable of this.
- The biblically based renewal movement in the Coptic Church, which has steadily gained momentum since 1930. It strongly emphasizes Bible study and personal faith, and many are fervent witnesses for the Lord. Monasticism sees a rejuvenation as well. Pray for the growth and effectiveness of this movement of the Spirit.
- Christians are numerous in business, the professions and health services, but overall the Coptic influence within Egypt is much less than their large numbers warrant. Pray that Copts might have a positive and transforming effect in the nation, just as Joseph did millennia ago.

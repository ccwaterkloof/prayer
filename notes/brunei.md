# Strategic prayer

- The Christian Church exists under very difficult conditions. Evangelism is illegal, and although the number of Christians grows, no new registrations for churches are forthcoming. No foreign Christian workers are permitted â€“ visiting ministers must arrive unannounced and in secret. Importing Bibles and Christian literature is illegal for ministry purposes, but not for personal purposes. Religious instruction in all schools, including the six Christian schools, is on Islam alone.

- The Malay majority are Muslim with a handful of Christians, none daring to publicly make his or her faith known. There is little reason for people to change their spiritual status quo; pray for the Spirit to move in the hearts of Malays.

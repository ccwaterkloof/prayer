# Strategic prayer

- There is a steady growth of **evangelicals**, who were only 2.1% (800,000) in 1960, but are now over 8% and numbering over nine million. Growth is in both international denominations and in vigorous newer indigenous movements. Pray that the momentum might be maintained. The highest concentrations of evangelicals are in large cities, in northern states bordering the USA and in southern states where there is a higher proportion of Amerindian peoples. Returnees from the USA are influential in bringing evangelical Christianity back with them. Pray for this growth to be sustained in both numbers and spiritual depth.
- The **missions** movement is beginning to blossom and play a greater role globally. An increasing number of congregations send and support missionaries. COMIMEX provides a nationwide umbrella linking most agencies, national and international, and involved denominations. Significant international agencies have been birthed in Mexico, such as PMI, with its involvement in the Muslim world. There may be as many as 1,200 Mexican evangelical missionaries with over 50 agencies. The majority of them serve abroad, with increasing numbers in the 10/40 Window.

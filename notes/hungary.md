# Strategic prayer

- The small, but historically rich, **evangelical movement** is growing in size, maturity, diversity and confidence. Many types of ministries are springing up around the nation, and the vision exists to see an evangelical church planted in every city, town and village in Hungary.
- **Unity across denominations** is experiencing much-needed growth, as churches come together to pray, worship and minister. There are also many prayer ministries that represent the different flavours of Christian faith – Budapest Prayer Wall, National Prayer Network and 168-hour Intercessory Prayer Chain are examples of these.
- The openness of the post-Communist 1990s has passed. It is now increasingly **difficult to openly witness** – restrictions forbid teachers, doctors and such from sharing their faith in the workplace. Pray for a new revival in the Church – following on those from 1939 and 1946-50 – that gives birth to a new spirit of witness and activism.

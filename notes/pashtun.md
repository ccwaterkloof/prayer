# People profile

The Pastun are one of the largest ethnic groups in Afghanistan – about 12.6 million. There are twice as many Pashtuns in Pakistan, concentrated in the northeast. Years of conflict have forced thousands to flee the region. Pashtuns speak various dialects of Pashto.

Pashtuns believe they are from the lost tribes of Israel and descendants of King Saul. They are a rugged, hard-working people who love children but find it hard to provide for them. They hide their women and celebrate manly courage. Pashtuns excel in hospitality, and it is central to their sense of honor to treat all guests well. They love poetry and music and are devout in their faith.

They are mostly Sunni Muslims whose primary identity is as zealous followers of Muhammad. The Taliban is a Pashtun religious movement seeking to enforce strict Sharia law. There has been decades of violence among the Pashtun, and Taliban extremism has caused great suffering.


# Strategic prayer

- There are no known multiplying movements among this people, but there is a “trickle” of people coming to Christ and some underground gatherings of believers. 

- The Scriptures and other evangelistic materials are increasingly available in Pushto via satellite TV and the internet. The long-awaited new translation of the Bible in the Pakistani dialect of Pushto was introduced in 2019!

- Because of the years of violence, there are substantial groups of Pashtuns living in diaspora communities in India, the UAE, and Europe. There are gatherings of believers in some diaspora communities who are remarkably bold in their witness, even to fellow Pashtuns as well as online with seekers in Afghanistan.

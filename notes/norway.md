# Strategic prayer

- Norway has a powerful spiritual heritage. The influence of Pietism, prayer and
  revival movements within Lutheranism over the past 200 years is still strong. About 90%
  of Norwegians are church members, but it can no longer be taken for granted that they are
  believers. Less than 10% of young people are committed Christians, and only 4% of the nation
  attend church on any given Sunday. More than half doubt or don’t believe in the existence of
  God. Pray for the roots of Norway’s rich Christian past to be reestablished.
- Norway has strong mission-sending traditions and lively mission vision today.
  The country remains proportionally one of the top sending nations,
  even while again focusing on the renewed need for home missions. But a new wave of younger
  missionaries is called for.

# People profile

Arab Muslim invaders made Baghdad the capital of the Abbasid Empire in the 8th century.
Today, 21 million Arab people live in Iraq. Two thirds Shia and one third Sunni Muslims.
The Sunni-Shia divide has caused much suffering and sorrow among Iraqi Arabs.

Since the toppling of Saddam Hussein in 2003 there has been great instability with Islamic
State overtaking northern Iraq and eastern Syria in 2014. Some estimate that as many as
500,000 people have died violently in Iraq since then.

# Strategic prayer

- Some Iraqi Christians have chosen to stay or even return to Baghdad to live as salt and
  light among their neighbors. Praise God that numbers of Iraqi Arab believers from Muslim
  backgrounds are being discipled and are growing in their faith.
- Praise God for plenty of resources available for sharing the Gospel with Iraqi Arabs.
  Christian literature has directed people to media sites, leading to increased interest
  in the Gospel. However, many inquiries come from outside major cities where follow up is
  difficult due to the security situation that prevents easy access to these provinces.
- Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis live in diaspora throughout the world, and Christians
  are reaching out to them through friendship and service in countries where there is
  freedom to share.

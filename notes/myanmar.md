The people of Myanmar (Burma) are, in many ways, trapped.

The Burmese general Min Aung Hlaing who led a coup in February 2021 has now declared himself prime minister. His emergency powers will continue for the next two years. Afterwards, he has allegedly promised an election process.

Meanwhile, many who have protested the military takeover have gone missing or been found dead.

To top it all off, Myanmarâ€™s healthcare system has all but collapsed, just as the spread of the new COVID Delta variant accelerates globally. Many critical patients are being turned away from hospitals to die at home.

It seems the Burmese have nowhere left to turn.

We know that God promises in His Word to never leave nor forsake us, but only about 6% of the 55 million Burmese have a relationship with Him.

The Burmese may feel trapped in unimaginable circumstances, but with Jesus there is freedom! May they know the Truth. And may He set them free!

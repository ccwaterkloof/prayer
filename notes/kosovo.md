# Strategic prayer

- Kosovar Albanians are 98% Muslim, with about 1,000 evangelicals in 12 congregations in Kosovo. The upheaval involving Serbia and NATO opened doors for evangelism and ministry.
- Pray for the peace of Jesus to heal the hatred between ethnic Serbs and Albanians.
- The evangelical Church is very small but growing. From around 80 believers at the outbreak of war in 1998, there are now over 2,000, mostly young men and teens (often, girls are forced to keep their faith secret). Churches mushroomed with the foreign humanitarian presence, but several have since closed; there are now about 35 evangelical churches, and they are quite evangelistic in their outlook. The formation of an evangelical alliance (Evangelical Movement of Kosovo) and the recognition of evangelicals as one of Kosovoâ€™s five faith communities are both answers to prayer. Pray for unity among believers and continued growth in numbers and spiritual maturity.

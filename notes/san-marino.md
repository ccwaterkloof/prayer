# Strategic prayer

- The Sammarinese are Catholic by tradition and culture, but most give only lip
  service to the Church and are very materialistic. Increasing numbers reject their religious
  heritage altogether.
- San Marino proclaims itself “Ancient Land of Liberty”. There is freedom to worship,
  but evangelism hardly exists. In the past, outreach by evangelicals resulted in jailing or expulsion
  from the country. As a result, no churches or ministries currently evangelize in San Marino.

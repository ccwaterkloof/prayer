# Strategic prayer

- Greenland has been Christianized, but not converted. Nearly every settlement has its Lutheran church building – but too many lack real spiritual life. Pray for renewal and new life for Dane and Greenlander alike.The tightly knit communities of Greenland could easily be impacted powerfully by a move of God.
- Evangelical witness is quite recent. In 1984, there were only about 20 born-again believers. Now, a growing evangelical movement in several denominations exists – mostly within the New Life Church/Pentecostal framework, although Brethren and NTM churches also exist.
- A new and more contemporary version of the Bible in Greenlandic was released in 2001 - pray that many will read it and be changed.
- Training for leaders and counsellors. With such widespread brokenness and responsiveness, more Greenlandic Christians must be equipped to minister effectively. Recently, INO established a leadership training school for local believers, for the equipping of the national Church.

# Strategic prayer

- **Evangelical growth** is high and sustained amid the upheaval. Evangelicals grew from 2.2% in 1960 to 29.8% in 2010.This is more than a 40-fold numeric increase in 50 years, with no signs of such growth abating.
- **Poverty** is a deep-seated issue that is both the cause and the result of many political troubles. After years of civil war, natural disasters further devastated the nationâ€™s economy and infrastructure. Economic wisdom and long-term development are needed. Many economic uplift programmes have been launched by CEPAD (The Evangelical Committee for Relief and Development), AoG and others.This longstanding state of poverty also shapes the spirituality of Nicaragua, with both liberation theology and prosperity theology playing major roles.
- Division among and even within churches on liberation theology, the work of the Holy Spirit and interpersonal conflicts. The Evangelical Alliance of Nicaragua (FAENIC) represents 62 denominations and is crucial in forging a healthy national Christian presence.

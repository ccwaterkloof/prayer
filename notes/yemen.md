# Strategic prayer

- Amidst the terrible suffering, Yemenis are finding life in Christ through radio, Bible distribution, careful witness, and dreams and visions from the Lord! Believers meet secretly and only in small groups. They often face dangerous opposition. Praise God for these followers of Jesus. Pray for them as they learn how to honour their culture and family while faithfully serving the Lord. There may be more Yemeni followers of Christ than all the other indigenous groups in the Arabian Peninsula combined!
- Yemen has suffered in recent decades from three civil wars, tribal conflicts, and war in nearby countries. Currently Yemen is divided between Shiâ€™a Houthi rebels who control much of the country and Sunni forces supporting the ousted President. Radical Islamist groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS have seized on the chaos to take control of other areas. May the God of peace and justice bring both to this land of great suffering.

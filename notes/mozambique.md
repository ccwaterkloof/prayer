# Strategic prayer

- There is a civil war threatening after the October 2024 elections, with the opposition party PODEMOS disputing the election results. Pray for peace and freedom for the people of Mozambique.
- An additional threat is the Islamist terror group IS-CAP (Islamic State Central Africa Province), visiting murder and havoc upon a predominantly Muslim region in the north, targeting Christians especially. Pray for Godâ€™s mercy upon this long-suffering land!
- Amazing growth in the Church since the end of the first civilt war in 1992. After harsh persecution under the Marxist-oriented regime, the Christian faith spread rapidly, tripling from 1985 to 2010. After being highly unevangelized, Mozambique now sees many from all faiths and regions beginning to follow Christ.
- Training church leadership is an urgent priority, probably the most strategic spiritual
  issue in the country. As many as 80% of pastors/church leaders have little or no formal
  training, with a large number, possibly even the majority, functionally illiterate. Funds and
  facilities for formal theological education are lacking. Pray that the effective formation of
  biblically literate, godly leaders would match the ever-increasing needs of the church.

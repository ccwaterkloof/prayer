# Strategic prayer

1. **The need for a united vision**. The Portuguese Evangelical Alliance (EA) continues to grow in impact. Pray for wisdom, vision and courage for its leaders and members, since the EA plays a key role.
2. **The need for passion for the lost**. The Portuguese Church has a unique role to play because of the widespread use of the language. Most churches could easily increase involvement in evangelism and in mission. Some churches and missions are active in sending. A new national sending agency (MEVIC) recently began.
3. **Church planting**. Many more churches are needed. DAWN, together with the EA, targets a goal of 4,000 evangelical churches. Several groups adopted cell-church models but face the difficulty that, for many Portuguese, a physical structure communicates religious legitimacy. Pray for continued church growth, for affordable and appropriate meeting places and for leaders for these future churches.

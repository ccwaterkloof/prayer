# Strategic prayer

1. Unexpected church growth over the last 20 years. From only
   a few thousand Christians surviving into the 1990s (0.07% evangelical in 1985), believers
   may now top 3.5% of the population. This growth is almost entirely through church
   multiplication, and done by indigenous church planters and evangelists.
2. Spiritual darkness persists in Cambodia and must be lifted by prayer. That darkness
   is seen in the ubiquitous spirit shrines, Buddhismâ€™s opposition to any ideological rival
   and a general moral collapse. Structures of sin are prevalent throughout, and the people of Cambodia are made to suffer by the enemy of souls. Pray for the light of the gospel to so shine that the structures of society as well as of individuals may be decisively changed.
3. Mature leadership for the churches is the greatest challenge. The loss of so many
   educated people in the Khmer Rouge slaughter, combined with the dysfunctional society,
   pushed many new Christians quickly into leadership before they were ready. Pray for a greater sense of unity and for more partnerships that are effective.

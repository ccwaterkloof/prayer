# Strategic prayer

- Church growth has been massive and remains so. A large majority of West Africa’s
  evangelicals live in Nigeria. Nigeria has the world’s 4th, and possibly 3rd, highest
  number of evangelicals in the world. Catholics, Anglicans, traditional Protestant
  groups, and newer Pentecostal and charismatic groups all grow. Much growth comes from
  among Muslims and those who follow tribal religions. This growth often happened quietly,
  in less obvious ways. Praise God for the millions who have come to know Him in Nigeria!
- Nigeria’s greatest spiritual challenge is discipleship, not Islam, not corruption, and
  not even the need for missions. The Church grew so fast that many new believers have
  little chance to be discipled. Much division and false teaching enters into churches.
  Prosperity teaching distorts the gospel.
- Persecution of Christians continues to increase, especially in the north. Some extremist
  Muslim groups have killed thousands of people, and have destroyed hundreds or even
  thousands of churches.

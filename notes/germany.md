# Strategic prayer

- Evangelism, outreach and mission are being rediscovered in Germany. From the
  dynamic, media-driven outreach of ProChrist/JesusHouse all the way to increasing missional
  values in the mainline churches, there is a growing confidence in the gospel in many circles that
  is being expressed in outward demonstrations of faith.
- The Evangelical Alliance is a vital network for over 1.2 million evangelicals in all
  denominations and hundreds of missions. It exists as a focal point for prayer, theological
  reflection, cooperative projects, social action, evangelism and mission.
- Eastern Germany remains, for the most part, both economically and spiritually
  unregenerated. About 80% are effectively unevangelized, and 65% are agnostic or
  atheist. But there is a solid, core group of believers standing firm for Christ.
- Foreigners. The rising tide of immigrants, guest workers, international students and
  refugees since 1989 has been a challenge to German government and society. In many
  inner cities, migrants are the majority population. Pray for the AMIN (Arbeitskreis f√ºr Migration und Integration). They are a fellowship of mission groups seeking to evangelize through a wide variety of ethnic ministries.

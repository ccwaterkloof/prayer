# Strategic prayer

1. Jannie's PCR test to return negative and in time for his flight on Wednesday morning.
2. Frits Van Der Merwe, seasoned missioanry to the Makhuas who were supposed to join the trip at OR Thambo has just undergone emergency dental surgery in PE and has been declared unfit to fly. Pray for safety and healing and comfort. Frits is tough, but this must be a HUGE disappointment.
3. Jannie and Gerard, the translator, and Frits' wife Nickey plan to go ahead without Frits. Pray for every leg of this tricky trip (see itinerary below) and **favour** with officials as we each carry Bibles and lots of necessary supplies for the work.
4. We expect a big batch of the Bibles to be ready for us in Lichinga where we had them couriered. Pray for these copies that they will indeed be there and in good condition.
   More updates to follow as we move ahead!

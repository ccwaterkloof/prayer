# Strategic prayer

- The Basotho were Christianized generations ago, but most were never fully converted.
  The **social pressure** against becoming _bapholosoa_, or born again, is wielded by traditional
  religious forces, mainline churches and family members alike. Pray for the Holy Spirit to sweep out impurities from the churches and bring new life.
- **Traditionalism** and nominalism are common in the Catholic Church and in the Lesotho
  Evangelical Church. The latter is the fruit of the great pioneering work by French missionaries
  of the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society. Many AIC churches compromise with African traditional religious practices and beliefs.
- **The mountain population** of 600,000 are among the poorest and most vulnerable. Nominally Christian, they have little contact with the life-giving gospel. Lesothoâ€™s churches are beginning to wake up to this challenge. Operation UP, an indigenous agency, is committed to reaching every family in the mountains and planting 50 evangelical churches in the next five years. Other agencies include AIM, Joy to the World, YWAM, Fill the Gap Ministries, the Full Gospel Church and Global Evangelism Ministries. Many villages are accessible only on horseback, others by MAF plane. Pray for fruitful and sustainable ministry that yields thriving churches.

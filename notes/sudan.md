# Strategic prayer

- There was once a strong Christian presence in northern Sudan, and for nearly a millennium the majority of the population were Christian. Muslims invaded and defeated the Christians at the end of the 13th Century and gradually Islamized the area by the 15th Century. Since then there has been serious efforts to uproot, wipe out or convert Christian populations in Sudan. Through the prayers of many God is busy changing this:
- After a miraculous coup in 2019, Sudan is now no longer officially a Muslim country, but since 2020 it is a secular state.
- On 3 September, Prime Minister Hamdok appointed 14 civilian ministers, including the first female foreign minister and the first Coptic Christian, also a woman!

# People profile

Most Moroccans are either Berbers or have Berber ancestry. Yet 60% speak Arabic as their
mother tongue and think of themselves as Arabs. The 31 million Moroccan Arabs are
generally open, hospitable, and friendly people. They love to visit in cafes and in their
homes. Their Islam is generally conservative and moderate.

It is very difficult to accurately assess the number of Moroccan Christians. Informed
estimates vary from 2,000 to 5,000 Arab and Berber believers. These have come through
media, spread around the country, and include both Arab and Berber groups. There are a
number of informal networks of underground house churches. Several media ministries that
have had a lot of response from Morocco over the years.

Persecution is normally not violent, but the government keeps a close eye on believers and
churches. Most Moroccan believers donâ€™t have freedom to practice their faith openly. The
greatest opposition usually comes from family and community members.

# Strategic prayer

- Pray for entire families to hear and come to faith in Jesus together.
- Pray for the disenfranchised to find hope and meaning in Jesus instead of radicalism.
- Pray for Jesus to reveal Himself through visions, dreams, and the Injil (New Testament)

# Strategic prayer

- **There are only a handful of Christians** among this entire people, but we see a new day of growth and witness among the Saharawi through low-key mission work and national believers.There are openings for ministry to refugees through relief and development, and difficult political and living conditions lead to considerable openness.The JESUS film is available and the Hassaniya NT is in preparation. Pray for those who are, and could be, serving among them.
- Pray for a peaceful and fair resolution to decades of costly conflict.
- There are about 270,000 **refugees** in four main camps near Tindouf, Algeria. The plight of the refugees has opened doors for humanitarian and Christian aid, providing opportunities to spread the love of Christ.

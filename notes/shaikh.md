# People profile

- The Shaikh are thought to be the largest grouping of unreached Muslims in the world.
  Though the majority are Sunni Muslims, there are Shia and Sufi expressions of Islam
  among them as well.
- The Shaikh are not an ethnic group, and they donâ€™t share a common language, but they do
  share a common history, caste, and religious tradition. They converted to Islam since
  Muslims first arrived in South Asia in the 8th century. While millions of Shaikh are
  spread throughout many countries in South Asia, the majority live in Bangladesh
  (Bengali-speaking), India (mostly Urdu-speaking), and Pakistan (Punjabi-speaking).

# Strategic prayer

- There are believers among the Shaikh in Bangladesh, but not a known movement. There are
  no known movements to Christ among the Shaikh in Pakistan. It is reported that there is
  significant ministry among the Shaikh in India, but details are hard to come by.
- Pray for any efforts to reach these people with the Gospel and for encouragement for the
  few who do follow Christ to be bold in their witness.

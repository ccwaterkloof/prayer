# Strategic prayer

- Evangelical Christians have increased from 2% in 1970 to nearly 17% in 2010. The
  Association of Evangelicals is providing good leadership. Pray for continued growth in the
  gospel witness.
- Due to Dominica’s economic vulnerability, many pastors must take a second job to
  support themselves. Pastoral “burn-out” is a resultant problem.

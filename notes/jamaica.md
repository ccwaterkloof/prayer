# Strategic prayer

- Jamaica has a rich but little-known **mission sending** history. Praise God for those rediscovering this spiritual legacy and remobilizing Jamaica to once again become a sending powerhouse.

- Jamaican Christianity needs **reformation and renewal**. It enjoys one of the world’s highest number of churches per square mile, but the majority of self-proclaimed Christians in Jamaica neither attend church nor lead a Christian life. Networks – such as the Jamaica Council of Churches, the Jamaica Association of Evangelicals and the Jamaica Pentecostal Union as well as many ministers’ fraternals – seek to address and combat the political and social ills while
  working for unity and true Christian faith and practice in the Church.

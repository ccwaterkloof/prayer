title: 'Iranian Azeri'

# People profile

Out of a global population of about 40 million, 17 million Azeris live in Iran. This makes
them Iran’s largest minority group and they live mostly in the northwest. Though
ethnically related to Sunni Muslim Turks, older, rural Iranian Azeris feel a stronger
religious bond with their Shia Iranian neighbors.

Azeris often use the Turkic language of Azerbaijani at home, Persian in school and work,
and Arabic for their religious practices.

Interestingly, Iran’s Supreme Leader Khamenei is an Azeri.

# Strategic prayer

- The lingering, deadly disputes between Armenian Christians and Azerbaijani Muslims in
  the Nagorno-Karabakh border region remain an open wound in the Azeri psyche and an
  obstacle to some regarding faith. These identity issues, whether nationalistic or
  religious, impact daily life for Iranian Azeris no matter where they live.
- Plenty of materials are available in the Azeri language for ministry, including
  Scriptures, the Jesus Film, internet resources, and satellite television programs. There
  are 10,000-17,000 believers in Azerbaijan, and several churches are reaching out to
  Azeris in surrounding countries. But, sharing the Gospel with Azeris in Iran is very
  risky. Pray for the multiplying Iranian Church to obey the call to reach Iranian Azeris.

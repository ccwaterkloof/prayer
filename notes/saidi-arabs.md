# People profile

- The Saidi Arab people live in Upper Egypt bordering Sudan. They are a simple and sincere
  people - mostly following Sunni Islam. A sizable percentage are Coptic Christians with
  ancient Christian traditions.
- “In Upper Egypt, shame can be worse than death,” says an Egyptian man describing the
  culture of revenge killing that often characterizes family feuds in Upper Egypt.
- 80% of Egypt's severe poverty is concentrated in Upper Egypt and many Saidi's live in
  extreme poverty, earning less than $2/day

# Strategic prayer

- With almost 5% evangelical believers, the Coptic Christians in Upper Egypt is very
  strategic. They form the largest Christian population in the Middle East.
- Christians are often mistreated and sometimes experience violent persecution from their
  Muslim neighbors. The 21 men kidnapped and beheaded by ISIS on the seashore in Libya in
  2015 were Coptic Christians from Upper Egypt.
- Pray that God will break the honor/shame dynamic that permeates all aspects of their
  lives, by the liberty that the Gospel brings.

# Strategic prayer

- The Czech Republic has a rich Christian heritage that played a big role in the reformation (Hess) and world mission (Moravians), but since the 2nd world war, Atheism has been the dominant religion to this day. Even so, Czech churches now send missionaries to several countries in Europe and around the world. This is an answer to prayer and will hopefully also generate spiritual vitality on the home front.
- Freedom for Czechs has too often translated into a “free-for-all”. A generally successful shift to a market economy is positive for the country, but it places economic stress on too many of the most vulnerable.The moral vacuum that has emerged sees hedonistic materialism assume primacy;crime,sexual immorality,substance abuse as well as depression and suicide are more prevalent today than in Communist times.Atheism rose from 40% in 1991 to 60% in 2001 (and 71% non-religious in 2010), but apparently this does not preclude widespread use of horoscopes and a fuzzy mishmash of spiritual ideas. Pray for this existential and spiritual heaviness over the Czech Republic; pray that serious soul-searching may take place and that a shift in the spiritual atmosphere might occur.

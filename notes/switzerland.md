# Strategic prayer

- Unity is increasing among churches of different backgrounds for the purpose of
  jointly proclaiming Christ. These include traditional evangelical, charismatic and rapidly
  growing immigrant churches.
- The great reformers, Calvin and Zwingli, expounded the truths of Scripture in this
  land, but few today have any interest or understanding of real Christianity. Wealth, comfort,
  indifference and a vague religiosity are the norm. The younger generation explores eastern
  religions and the occult as much as Christianity. Many baptized as children retain no real link
  with a church, and enrolled membership of Protestants and Catholics dropped from over 90%
  to 70% in the last 30 years. Pray that the Swiss may find the true way in Jesus Christ and that
  the nation might be stirred again by the Holy Spirit.
- Renewed vision for evangelicals is bubbling up. The Swiss Evangelical Alliance, Free
  Churches and other agencies are working on a renewed vision for the evangelization of
  Switzerland. Most Christian non-profit groups have united as a more audible voice within
  society regarding religious freedom, evangelism and mission, aid and social responsibility,
  environmental issues, media, youth and others. While church planting remains an important goal,
  they see renewal and Christian testimony within society as equally important. Pray for increasing
  numbers of congregations as well as for renewal of many existing ones. Pray for newer groups,
  such as the International Christian Fellowship (ICF) and the house church movement, that are
  reaching people outside of traditional church structures.

# Strategic prayer

- The Tswana were the first Bantu people in Africa to respond to the gospel; several
  tribes turned to God in the 19th Century through the LMS from England. Other missions
  followed. Today, the majority of Tswana are Christian in name.
- Botswana's economic growth is steady, corruption rare and a multiparty democracy the
  norm. Praise God for the stability that enables the government to build up the nation’s
  infrastructure. Give thanks also for religious freedom and openness, allowing many
  agencies to establish work here.
- African Initiated Churches (Spiritual Churches or AIC) are the largest religious
  grouping in the country. They are made of several large and also hundreds of small
  denominations. There is a great deal of diversity among them, ranging from biblically
  orthodox groups to marginal fringe groups. Most of these Churches stress the healing
  power of God. Of all the churches, they are most clearly engaged in the struggles of
  culture and faith, which have led some into syncretistic practices. Since there are no
  paid pastors, many are led by those with little education or theological training.
- The 2024 elections saw the ruling party of 58 years emphatically voted out. The peaceful
  transition to the new administration was praiseworthy and a sign of Botwana’s stability
  and integrity. The national programme of Vision 2036 seeks “prosperity for all” and
  includes a sustainable environment, human and social development, good governance and
  peace. Pray that it might be so! After all, only under Jesus’ Lordship can such a vision
  be truly achieved.

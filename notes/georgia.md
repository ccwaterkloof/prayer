# Strategic prayer

- Positive social, economic and political changes continue since 1991. Reduced corruption and democratic reform pave the way for a more peaceful future. Openness to spirituality and Christianity in particular has increased greatly. The former Department of Atheism at the national university is now a theological faculty, and legal changes make it easier for non-Orthodox faiths to operate more freely and with less threat of persecution. Christian groups of all expressions have experienced growth in this nation in recent decades.

- The Georgian Orthodox Church’s history stretches back toAD 150;it can be regarded as the world’s second-oldest Christian nation. Communist repression, infiltration and subversion brought both martyrdom and compromise. Since Communism’s collapse and Georgian independence, many have returned to the Church of their ancestors. Some minority groups converted as well. For most Georgians, this is mostly an expression of nationalism and cultural identity, not a living spiritual faith. Pray for access to the Word of God, and that through it many may find the Truth of the gospel. Pray also for renewal among Orthodox clergy; some small beginnings of this are occurring.

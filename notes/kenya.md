Missions vision has significantly altered Kenyaâ€™s church scene. A large and increasing number of Kenyans are serving cross-culturally within Kenya or abroad, with agencies such as Horn of Africa Mission, but the potential is so much greater. For prayer:

- The clarion call to see a church accessible to every person, community and people group in Kenya was championed by Vision 2010, but results of this nationwide initiative are not yet known. Churches are very unevenly distributed throughout Kenya.
- Finish the Task/Afriserve has been making the Church aware of the least reached within Kenya since the late 1990s. It continues to raise awareness, prayer and workers for completing the effective evangelization of Kenya.
- The African Centre for Missions (ACM), opened in 2000, mobilizes for cross-cultural missions by training trainers, missionaries and mission pastors. ACM is a collaboration of several major denominations, the AEA and others.
- For churches, denominations, Bible schools and seminaries to make the Great Commission a key part of their spiritual DNA. Kenya has the capacity to send many more missionaries, especially to the needy Horn of Africa region.

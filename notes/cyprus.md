# Strategic prayer

- **The Orthodox Church** is a crucial focal point for Greek Cypriot culture and identity. The challenge lies in encountering the gospel amid the ethnic-cultural-political traditions. Pray for revival and fruit from their efforts to distrubute copies of the New Testemant in public schools.
- **Ethnic minority evangelicals** have grown rapidly among the English-speaking, Russian, Filipino, Sri Lankan and Iranian communities. Pray for their active and effective witness to their own communities and to the indigenous population. Several ministries work in this area.
- Cyprus is a major base for Christian organizations ministering to the surrounding Middle Eastern states. Like MECO, CCCI, YWAM and Interserve.
- Christian literature in Arabic, Greek and other languages that is both printed and stocked for distribution throughout the region.The Bible Society has distributed many Greek NTs throughout the ROC.
- SAT-7, which is based in Cyprus. This key, innovative, Christian satellite TV ministry is hugely influential, with a wide audience and good response, and is impacting the whole of the Arab world with its daily programmes.
- Christian radio programmes broadcast over Cyprus in Greek, English and most of the immigrant languages, amounting to over 35 hours per week. No Christian radio is yet available in Turkish.

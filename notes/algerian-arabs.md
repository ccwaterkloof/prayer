# People profile

Algeria was first conquered by Arabs in the 8th century. After suffering under Arab, Berber, and Turkish empires for a thousand years, it was colonized by the French in 1830. Algeria won independence in 1962 after an eight-year war that left one million dead. Algeria is 98% Muslim, and the government tightly controls Algerian Islam in its fight against extremism.

Though most Algerians are ethnically Berber, after centuries of Arab influence, most see themselves as Arab. Algerian Arabic is spoken by 85% of Algeriaâ€™s 42.5 million people.


# Strategic prayer

- Since the end of the Algerian civil war (1991-2002), when all missionaries were forced to leave the country or be killed by the Islamists, only a few westerners have been able to return long-term. Encouragingly, Kabyle Christians are catching the vision to reach out to Arabs.

- Pray for all Algerian Arabs to have access to the Bible and Gospel materials. Pray especially for media and internet outreach. 

- Pray for Algerian emigrants to encounter the Gospel and return home to share it.

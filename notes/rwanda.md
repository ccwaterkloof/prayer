# Strategic prayer

- Rwanda has made great progress in many areas since the tragic events of 1994-95. Political stability since 2000 allows for rebuilding and developing roads, buildings, government services, water and sanitation, education and communications systems. Financial recovery is encouraging, with Rwanda one of the fastest-growing economies in
  Africa.
- The presence of women in leadership. Over half the elected parliament are female.
- Give praise for the commitment to reconcile and peace-build. The very fact that efforts are being made in a land with centuries of endemic ethnic tension, is cause for praise. Also encouraging is the fact that churches are at the forefront of the movement.
- Young peopleâ€™s ministries, such as Scripture Union, AEE/Rwanda(AE), YWAM, YFC, Moucecore, Solace Ministries and Christ for the Nations Ministries, which work across denominations. Bible reading programmes, prayer groups, youth camps, alternate education programmes, AIDS awareness as well as assisting orphans, street kids and child heads-of-households are all aspects of current work.

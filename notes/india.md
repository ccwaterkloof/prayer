# Strategic prayer

- Big - the biggest country with more than 1.4 billion people. One in five people live in
  India!
- Diverse - more than 2,500 distinct people groups who speak over 19,500 languages.
- Challenging - there is more human need in India than in any other country. Approximately
  196 million people are malnourished. Roughly 30 million children in India are orphans.
- Unreached - about 95% of the population live in unreached people groups
- The European Union and the United States are both negotiating major trade agreements
  with India — deals that could reshape supply chains and economic influence. As nations
  seek to access India’s markets, we’re reminded: economic access doesn’t equal Gospel
  access. This is a critical moment to pray that as doors open for trade, may hearts open
  to Christ.

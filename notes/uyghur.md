# People profile

Most of the estimated 11 million Uyghur in China live in the far western region of
Xinjiang. Another 1.5 million Uyghur live outside of China. They are a Turkic people who
trace their Muslim heritage back to the 10th century.

Life is getting harder at all levels for the Uyghurs in China. Their freedoms are being
curtailed and their rights taken away. They are stereotyped as terrorists. Up to two
million Uyghur are held in “re-education” detention camps.

# Strategic prayer

- There may only be about two thousand Uyghur believers in all of China. Some Han
  believers are actively reaching out to Uyghurs, taking up the task following the recent
  expulsion of most expatriate workers.

- Uyghur Muslims have traditionally been open to talking about religion – more so than the
  Hui, for example – yet under the current crackdown, people are shying away from
  religious discussions. Family opposition to converts is less and less of a concern
  compared to government opposition to all religions.

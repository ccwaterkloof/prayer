# Strategic prayer

- Religious freedom in the post-Soviet era has seen many dynamic new Christian
  groups emerge, injecting new life into the nationâ€™s spirituality. Unity between different
  Christian groups and denominations is very good, especially for a former Soviet state.
- The shortage of trained Christian leaders is a result of rapid growth in the newer
  churches and difficulty in establishing denominations. Religious freedom has also
  yielded an increase of cults and theological error. Solid biblical foundations must be
  established, but leaders trained abroad too frequently do not return.

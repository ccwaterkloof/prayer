# Strategic prayer

- Vision for the future must be recaptured. Previous church planting initiatives have waned, but there are new ideas via the Slovak Evangelical Alliance, Natural Church Development and others. Discipleship, evangelism and church multiplication – on the grassroots level – are essential for the gospel to reach the entire nation. Many desire to see churches in every city and town, but to achieve this, thousands of new congregations must be planted. Pray for this ambitious desire to be achieved.
- Youth work remains an exciting area with diverse activities and ministries. SIET is a network of national youth organizations with an excellent record for cooperation among denominations, including Lutherans, and a strong focus on training. Josiah Venture is central to this vital network. Pray that God may raise up a new generation of holy, faith-filled believers through these movements. Pray for IFES and CCCI as they minister to tertiary-level students.
- A huge challenge to the Church is the growth of Jehovah’s Witnesses – their attendance outstrips that of Protestant evangelicals.

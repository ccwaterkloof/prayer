# People profile

Around 3 million Afar peoples live in the Horn of Africa â€“ primarily Ethiopia, Eritrea,
and Djibouti. Their region crosses the borders of these three countries and is sometimes
referred to as the Afar Triangle. They are a proud ethnic group and highly
individualistic, with a distinct Afar language.

The Afar are primarily nominal Sunni Muslim.

The Afar are nomadic, moving from highlands to lowlands as the seasons change. They mostly
raise livestock. The Afar are divided into two classes: the Adoimara (the working class)
and the Asaimara (the politically-dominant, noble class).

# Strategic prayer

- We praise God that the Afar currently have a complete Bible translation and access to
  the Jesus Film in their heart language! Yet more Gospel resources are desperately
  needed. The Afar tragically remain an unreached people group with no active witness for
  the Gospel.
- Not many outsiders want to engage Afar peoples, and the Afar are suspicious of
  foreigners. But Ethiopia, the nation with the most Afar people, is a largely Christian
  nation surrounded by Islamic countries. This already established Ethiopian Church
  presents an open door for the Gospel in this region.
- Because the Afar reach across multiple borders, if family groups and even tribes started
  to turn to Jesus, it could impact the entire Horn of Africa.

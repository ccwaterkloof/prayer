# Strategic prayer

- Of the 29 million Madagassy people, more than 40% are under 15 years old.
- Through corrupt governance the country ranks 173 out of 193 on the Human Development
  Index.
- 11% of the population are considered unevangelised
- In the spring of 2025 public dissatisfaction has morphed into anger over government
  corruption, high unemployment and high cost-of-living. Widespread protests turned deadly
  before the President fled the country and the government dissolved. A newly appointed
  leader of the Senate is in charge until elections are held.

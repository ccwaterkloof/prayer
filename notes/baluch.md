# People profile

There are 10-12 million Baluch people spread across Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the surrounding region – an area known as “Baluchistan.” They likely migrated from the Caspian Sea region around the 6th/7th centuries and settled in this huge, mostly arid, region. Three main dialects are spoken: Western Baluchi, in Southeastern Iran and Southern Afghanistan; Southern Baluchi, spoken in the Arabian Peninsula and the southern part of Baluchistan province in Pakistan; and Eastern Baluchi, spoken in the Eastern part of Baluchistan province in Pakistan (it is so different that it almost constitutes a separate language).


# Strategic prayer

- There is little outreach work happening among the Baluch. A translation team is working to complete a modern Bible translation, but because of very low literacy rates and the dangers of possessing printed Christian materials, oral resource distribution strategies are being developed using satellite TV, radio, and especially the internet. Most people – even nomads – have access to these kinds of media! A variety of resources have been developed in Baluchi, including the JESUS film, and more are being produced.

- While the church in Iran is growing rapidly, even without property or buildings, there are very few Baluch believers. Engagement of Baluch by Iranian believers is difficult and uncommon. In the rest of Baluchistan, especially outside of major urban areas, access to gospel-proclaiming believers is extremely rare. All 10-12 million Baluch are considered entirely unreached and almost totally unengaged.

# Strategic prayer

- Evangelicals have steadily grown from 4.6% in 1960 to 19% in 2010!
- Widespread legalism in churches. Pray for revival and a holy dissatisfaction with the spiritual status quo.
- Pastors are stretched, with 70% of pastors forced to work bivocationally.
- Unity is an uphill battle against significant cultural and denominational diversity. Pray for initiatives that will break down these walls and draw together Hispanic, English, German and Mayan-speaking believers.
- The less-reached peoples need clearer and more culturally appropriate ministry. These include the Garifuna, Mayans, Indians (almost entirely Hindu or Muslim) and Chinese.

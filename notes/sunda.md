# People profile

Thirty-eight million Sundanese live in the western third of the island of Java, with three
million more living in Lampung, Sumatra. The majority of Sunda still live in villages,
where most work as tenant farmers.

Muslim identity runs deep among this people group. They practice a Folk Islam that is
mixed with their ancient animistic beliefs. If one is no longer a Muslim, one is no longer
a Sunda, and can therefore be kicked out of the local community.

# Strategic prayer

- Christian resources are readily available, including the Scriptures, the Jesus Film, and
  Christian programming on the internet and local TV.

- The Sundanese church (approximately 35,000) is growing slowly. Many are open to the
  gospel, but there is no large movement to Christ. Discipling believers is difficult.
  Leadership development is slow because of the negative cultural characteristics the
  Sunda bring with them. There is no focused outreach to the 3 million Sundanese diaspora
  in Lampung.

- New converts face intense psychological pressure to return to Islam. While they are
  often kicked out of their local community, the Sunda do not tend to hold grudges. After
  time, believers can often return to their community, albeit as second-class citizens
  with no inheritance.

# Strategic prayer

- There is some encouraging progress on the spiritual scene, including a marked
  increase in spiritual openness among Danes. The number who believe in a personal God,
  while still low (33%), has notably increased in recent years. New churches are being planted,
  new ministries are being founded and unity among believers is increasing. Groups include Pray
  for Denmark and Intercessors for Denmark.
- Much of the Lutheran Church is experienced by ordinary Danes as ritualistic and dead,
  and the fresh winds of the Holy Spirit must blow through this institution. Church
  attendance is around 2%. There are a number of organizations promoting renewal or revival in
  the state Church â€“ Indre Mission, Luthersk Mission, Evangelisk Luthersk Mission, Oase and Nyt Liv.

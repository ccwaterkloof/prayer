# Strategic prayer

- Evangelical believers are not many (3.8%), but their numbers are growing. In particular, Lutheran Free Churches, Pentecostals and charismatic churches are increasing and displaying admirable unity and cooperation. The Pentecostal Church, together with World Horizons, runs a short-term discipleship ministry.
- The majority of Icelanders are Christian, but only nominally so. Biblical Christianity and a lifestyle of following Christ are alien concepts to most. Some of the more isolated areas are spiritual wastelands, with almost no active Christianity at all.

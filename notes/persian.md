# People profile

Persians make up 60-65% of Iran’s total population of nearly 83 million people. Sunni
Islam came to Iran via the Arab conquests of the 7th century, but Shia Islam become the
state religion in the 16th century.

Most Persians are warm, gracious, family-oriented food-lovers (their cuisine is
world-renowned) who enjoy picnics, long walks, and celebrations. Codes of polite behavior
run deep. Persians are known for their long, complicated, and cherished rituals of simply
saying hello and goodbye!

Iran is described by some émigrés as a prison-like country in chaos. An estimated 13
million live under the poverty line. Opium addiction is reaching epidemic levels. There
are approximately 200,000 street children. Prostitution is widespread, though hidden.
There are systematic crackdowns on political activists, anti-government demonstrators, and
human rights defenders. Many Iranians, 70% of whom are under age 35, are disillusioned by
Islam and consider themselves secular, if not atheist.

Iran has the fastest growing evangelical population in the world even though the
government rules that only Armenians and Assyrians can be Christian. Ethnic Persians must
remain Muslim. Therefore, all Christian activity is illegal. Persecution is severe.
Hundreds of Christians are arrested and/or imprisoned each year.

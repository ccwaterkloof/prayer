# Strategic prayer

1. Pray that peace might hold in this nation so troubled by violence in the past. A long-lasting armed conflict included the government, left-wing guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries, foreign multi-national corporations, and drug cartels.
2. The meltdown of neighbouring Venezuela has brought as many as 4 million Venezuelans into Colombia. Pray that believers in Colombia might be peacemakers amidst continuing tensions and violence.
3. 15 of the 94 Amerindian groups remain isolated and unevangelized. Pray for each of these precious groups to find the gospel before they disappear forever.

# Strategic prayer

Evangelicals are a small minority (about half a percent), and a high proportion of them are foreigners.
In the 23 evangelical churches, worship is conducted in nine different languages, and only a minority have full-time pastors. There is still a great need for more Bible teaching, more Christ-centered churches and more workers to labour in these churches.

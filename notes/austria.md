# Strategic prayer

- Almost all church growth occurs within evangelical/charismatic churches. Pentecostal churches nearly doubled between 2000 and 2010. Even so, all evangelicals number only 0.5% of the population. Pray for further multiplication of congregations where the Lord Jesus Christ is proclaimed and honoured. Pray also for the efforts of the Runde Tisch (WdV) working across all Christian blocs, as well as the Evangelical Alliance (ÖEA) and the Fellowship of Evangelical Congregations in Austria (ARGEGÖ).Their work is vital in bringing cooperation and partnership to the diverse Christian framework.
- Austria needs more full-time workers. It is possible that more Austrians are serving God outside Austria than inside it. Major foreign agencies: OM, International Teams, WV, DMG, CEF, Missionhaus Bibelschule.The majority of evangelical churches were planted through the ministry of these Kingdom workers and are often still dependent on their leadership. A traditionally slow and difficult field, Austria is showing signs of accelerating response to the gospel. Pray for the Lord of the harvest to send more workers, both Austrians and foreign missionaries, to this needy field.
- Foreign migrants and refugees have flooded into Austria since WWII – fleeing Communism up until 1990, then the Balkan strife, and now increasingly hailing from Asia. Pray that Austrian believers may demonstrate compassion to these strangers in their midst as the Bible commands.The gospel is being shared through Bible Society material and ministries such as Oasis Christian Centre. Pray for fruitfulness.
  a) The six ethnic groups of the former Yugoslavia. There are several evangelical congregations, but these peoples are some of the least reached of Europe.
  b) Muslim Turks, Afghans, Kurds, Pakistanis. Unabated immigration, high birthrates and poor integration stoke the fires of xenophobia from the far right.

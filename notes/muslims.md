# Profile

After Muhammad took control of Mecca in 630 AD, Islam spread in all directions. Today it
is the world’s second largest religion with roughly 1.8 billion followers, predominantly
in North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia.

Muslims everywhere are confessing Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior in greater numbers since
2000 — even in mass movements — than in the 1300 years prior. God is using every means to
bring the Truth of Jesus to His beloved children and to ignite the innate desire to know
their Creator.

In 1980, there was only one Christian missionary for every one million Muslims; today
there is one for every 100,000. Many more missionaries are needed; God is preparing Muslim
souls to receive the Truth of Jesus. The harvest is ripe.

Ramadan is a special month on the Muslim calendar. During this month Muslims around the
world intentionally seek Allah through prayer and fasting.

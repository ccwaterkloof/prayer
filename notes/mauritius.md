# Strategic prayer

- This complex multi-ethnic and multi-religious society makes evangelism a challenge; pray for great wisdom and discernment among Christians.The Hinduization of government and culture, as well as strong ancestral and ethnic ties, make it difficult for Indians to become believers. However, large numbers of Hindus are coming to Jesus through the bold witness of evangelical/Pentecostal churches.
- Training leaders is of prime importance.The AoG School of Ministry offers multi- level programmes ranging from correspondence to degree-level courses.TEE is utilized by most denominations and there are several correspondence schools, one being the Emmaus BCC. To train clergy and laity, the Anglican Church opened the Training Centre for Ministries and Community Development in Curepipe.The most exciting development is the rebirth of the Mauritian BibleTraining Institute,an evangelical Bible school started with input from SIM,which now enjoys a partnership withVose Seminary in Australia.

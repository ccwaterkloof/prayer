# Strategic prayer

- Sunni Islam is the state religion; the existence of Christians and Jews is tolerated, but the existence of an indigenous Moroccan Church is not accepted by the government. However, a Moroccan Church is emerging and accelerating in growth and maturity. While figures differ significantly, national Christian leaders estimate that there are about 2,000 Moroccan Christians in 20 to 30 small fellowships.
- Strength and perseverance for those under pressure from family, police or religious authorities. Intensified persecution and media attention have created opportunities for witness for those bold enough to take a stand. Pray that the community of believers might grow amid such persecution as it did in the years of the early Church, through faith, witness, mutual support and encouragement.
- Discipleship of believers is always difficult in a context of persecution, isolation and fear.This is intensified here by lack of Scripture and teaching materials, low levels of literacy and a shortage of established mature leaders. Pray that believers might increasingly engage with Scripture, focus on Christ, understand their faith and welcome newcomers.

# Strategic prayer

- Samoans have been Christian for over a century, and every village has at least one church. But the traditional class structure and pre-Christian cultural standards were not necessarily transformed by the gospel. Much of the Church suffers from nominalism, and rivalry among denominations.
- Mormons receive and send more missionaries to/from Samoa than any other denomination. Pray for all seeking to win Mormons to Jesus and to enlighten Samoan Christians of Mormonismâ€™s errors.
- Unity among evangelicals needs developing. Pray for the effectiveness of the Samoan Evangelical Alliance, formed in 1991 and for Graceland Broadcasting Network to be a bridge between evangelical groups.

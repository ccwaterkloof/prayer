# Strategic prayer

- The evangelical community is tiny, but multiplying. The Pentecostals, Baptists and
  Brethren have active growing churches. Evangelicals increased five-fold between 2000 and
  2005, but they still only number 0.03% of the population. Evangelical congregations, while only
  a handful, have a vision for sharing the gospel; pray for continued church growth. Pray for steadfast witness in the face of opposition, for unity among denominations and for fruitful ministry.
- The Albanians, a minority group among whom there are no evangelical churches or groups of believers.
- The Romani, officially only 0.5% of the population but likely significantly more. As in other
  Balkan nations, they are poorer, often despised and are proving more open to the gospel than
  most ethnic groups.

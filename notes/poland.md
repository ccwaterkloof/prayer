# Strategic prayer

1. The Catholic Church was long the guardian of Polish culture and nationalism in the face of Russian imperialism and Soviet communism. Polish Catholicism is particularly noted for its devotion to Mary. Polish Catholics believe Mary to be the spiritual queen of Poland, co-redemptrix and intercessor between humanity and Jesus.
2. There is a great need for witness in Poland, with 90% of municipalities having no evangelical church. The Ukrain war and the thousands of refugees has changed the situation, but up till recently there were more evangelicals in Saudi Arabia than in Poland.
3. Evangelical unity is progressing well from the divisions of years past, but genuine cooperation is still new territory for most churches.The Polish Evangelical Alliance now represents over 90% of evangelicals. Pray for the ministry of the Polish Ecumenical Council which brings together many Christian groups outside of the Roman Catholic Church. Pray that the Holy Spirit may bring reconciliation, fellowship and unity of vision in Jesusâ€™ name.

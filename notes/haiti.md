# Strategic prayer

1. **The spiritual response** to the tragedy of the 2010 earthquake was an almost universal outpouring of prayer, repentance and calling upon God for mercy and deliverance. Out of the disaster, God appears to be doing something radical and new among the people of Haiti. Reports abound that the three days of prayer and fasting called for by the president – replacing February 2010's Mardi Gras – were attended by over one million people.
2. **Evangelical Christians have steadily grown** in number over the decades, through evangelism, love in action and by openly standing against voodooism and the spiritual forces behind it.Vision Haiti (HAVIDEC), a concerted prayer movement that includes many denominations and organizations, is determined to see deliverance for Haiti through prayer.
3. Haiti must find release from the **bondages of its past**. The Spanish genocide against the indigenous Arawaks, and the cruel slavery instituted and maintained by the Spanish and then the French, form a tragic background.The tyrannies, cruelties and use of voodoo as a means of control have fostered a spirit of fear that permeates every level of society.
4. Haiti is the most impoverished nation in the Western Hemisphere. Its economy was especially devastated in the earthquake of 2010, which tragically killed roughly 200,000 people. The assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, and another earthquake in August 2021 have continually challenged an already staggering economy. Proper aid distribution is often prevented by violence and political instability. In addition to natural disasters, two-thirds of Haiti's population are unemployed and underemployed. Slightly over half the population is illiterate, and sex and labor trafficking are rampant. Increased gang activity around the capital city Port-au-Prince in recent years have led to an uptick in mass kidnappings for ransom, presenting further safety challenges for missions and NGO operations.

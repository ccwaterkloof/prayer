# Strategic prayer

- The Soviet departure left a moral vacuum, which many negative influences rushed to fill. EU money has also brought EU-style social problems. Alcohol, drugs, a rapidly growing sex trade, high abortion rates, the world’s fourth highest suicide rate and notable corruption in government Despite economic growth there is a prevalent attitude of spiritual apathy, even of hopelessness.
- Unprecedented unity in the churches was caused in part by challenges to biblical morality in society. The prayer and worship summits attended by the leaders of almost every denomination and confession – these meetings are the foundation for revival in Latvia. Pray that this unity might reverse the moral tide in Latvia.

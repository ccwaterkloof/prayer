# Strategic prayer

- The nation’s racial diversity could also be considered a racial divide. Inter-ethnic
  harmony is hindered by racially aligned politics and the activities of several extremist
  minorities among Muslims, Hindus and some “Christians”. Pray that the government may be
  impartial and fair to all ethnic groups and that the culture of corruption and bribery would be
  exposed and eliminated. The Church is one of the only structures connected to every community,
  and therefore has enormous but unrealized potential to bridge the racial divide. Pray that
  churches would be instruments of reconciliation and demonstrate that all are one in Christ.
- Christianity is professed by nearly two-thirds of the population, but true disciples
  faithful to God’s Word are not so common. Many Christians are nominal; many others are
  polluted by witchcraft, Afro-Spiritist beliefs and Hinduism-influenced worldviews. Family life
  and morals within the Christian sphere often do not demonstrate the lordship of Christ. Greater
  theological training – for leaders as well as laity – is needed and a discipleship mentality must
  be fostered. Thank God for the minority who do live to please God, and pray that purity and
  passion might be restored across all denominations.

# People profile

Najdi Arabic is spoken by 11 million people in central Saudi Arabia. In this land of the
origins of Islam, faith and culture are inseparable.

Political tensions are a major worry for Saudis, especially regarding Qatar, Iran, and the
Yemen war, as well as Saudi Arabia’s shifting relationship with the US. Another great
struggle for Saudis is fear – starting with a fear of Allah. Even the slightest doubt
about any aspect of Islam makes one a subject of Allah’s wrath. It is too dangerous to
research the questions on their minds.

# Strategic prayer

- While most Saudis have never conversed with a Christian in person, Christian satellite
  television and internet evangelism are proclaiming the gospel, and Saudis are
  responding!
- Converting to Christ is a crime. It brings deep shame on one’s family and may very well
  lead to imprisonment and death. However, some believers do meet together in spite of
  this.

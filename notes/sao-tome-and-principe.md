# Strategic prayer

- Evangelicals are free to minister and do see significant growth. There are close links
  with several Portuguese and Brazilian groups, such as the Assemblies of God, the Nazarenes,
  Deeper Life (Nigeria), YWAM and several others.
- Pray that their missionaries might have a great impact on these islands.
- Pray for the development of locally led, culturally relevant congregations
  with effectively trained Christian leaders.
- Pray also for local support of national workers and for
  the launching of an interdenominational training centre.
